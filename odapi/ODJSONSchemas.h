/* The header file contains the schema for the JSON messages that are being used. However it relies on Draf7 of the JSON schema
 * which is not fully implemented yet in a C++ library. The code is defined out that will use this as the implementation changes the
 * ABI code of the executable and is then not compatible with OpenCPN. There is basic checking for schema compliance but
 * it is not robust and it is possible to crash OpenCPN if the values are not valid.
